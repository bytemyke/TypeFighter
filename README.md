# TypeFighter

This is my entry for to 2024 Gamedev.js Jam! The final project can be viewed on [Itch](https://bytemyke.itch.io/typefighter).

TypeFighter is fighting game where you choose different powers to fight with. Unlike most traditional fighting games, this game is also a typing game. The idea is quite simple, each power has a required amount of energy. Each time you type a word you get +1 energy. However, if you type an incorect character your energy is reset to 0. All powers have a different ammount of required enrgy, damage, and some even have a special skill. For example, when using the power "theft" you steal two health from your opponnent when you damage them. 

For this project I used the [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) framework. I also used a wonderful [Phaser template](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-webpack) to get me started.
